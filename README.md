# RiotJS Style Guide

Opinionated *RiotJS Style Guide* for teams by [De Voorhoede](https://twitter.com/devoorhoede).


## Purpose

This guide provides a uniform way to structure your RiotJS code. Making it

* easier for developers / team members to understand and find things.
* easier for IDEs to interpret the code and provide assistance.
* easier to (re)use build tools you already use.
* easier to cache and serve bundles of code separately.

This guide is inspired by [AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) by John Papa.

## Module based development

Always construct your app out of small modules which do one thing and do it well. 

A module is a small self-contained part of an application. The RiotJS micro-framework is specifically designed to help you create *view-logic modules*, which Riot calls *tags*.

### Why?
Small modules are easier to learn, understand, maintain, reuse and debug. Both by you and other developers.

### How?
Each riot tag (like any module) must be [FIRST](https://addyosmani.com/first/): *Focused* ([single responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)), *Independent*, *Reusable*, *Small* and *Testable*.

If your module does too much or gets too big, split it up into smaller modules which each do just on thing.
Also ensure your tag module works in isolation. For instance by adding a stand-alone demo.
