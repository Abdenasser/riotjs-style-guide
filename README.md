# RiotJS Style Guide

Opinionated *RiotJS Style Guide* for teams by [De Voorhoede](https://twitter.com/devoorhoede).


## Purpose

This guide provides a uniform way to structure your RiotJS code. Making it

* easier for developers / team members to understand and find things.
* easier for IDEs to interpret the code and provide assistance.
* easier to (re)use build tools you already use.
* easier to cache and serve bundles of code separately.

This guide is inspired by the [AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) by John Papa.

## Tag module names

A tag module is a specific type of module, containing a Riot tag. 

Each module name must be:

* **Meaningful**: not overspecific, not overly abstract.
* **Short**: 2 or 3 words.
* **Pronouncable**: we want to be able talk about them.

Tag module names must also be:

* **Custom element spec compliant**: [include a hyphen](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/#concepts), don't use reserved names.
* **`app-` namespaced**: if very generic and otherwise 1 word, so that it can easily be reused in other projects.

### Why?

* The name is used to communicate about the module. So it must be short, meaningful and pronouncable.
* The `tag` element is inserted into the DOM. As such, they need to adhere the spec.

### How?

```html
<!-- recommended -->
<app-header />
<user-list />
<range-slider />

<!-- avoid -->
<btn-group /> <!-- short, but unpronouncable -->
<ui-slider /> <!-- all tags are ui elements, so is meaningless -->
<slider /> <!-- not custom element spec compliant --> 
```
