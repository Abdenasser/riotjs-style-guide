# RiotJS Style Guide

Opinionated *RiotJS Style Guide* for teams by [De Voorhoede](https://twitter.com/devoorhoede).


## Purpose

This guide provides a uniform way to structure your [RiotJS](http://riotjs.com/) code. Making it

* easier for developers / team members to understand and find things.
* easier for IDEs to interpret the code and provide assistance.
* easier to (re)use build tools you already use.
* easier to cache and serve bundles of code separately.

This guide is inspired by the [AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) by John Papa.

## Use `*.tag.html` extension

Riot introduces a new concept called *tags*, and suggests to use a `*.tag` extension.
However in essence these tags are simply custom elements containing markup. Therefore you should **use the `*.tag.html` extension**.

### Why?

* Tells developers it's not just HTML, but a Riot tag element.
* Improves IDE support (signals how to interpret).

### How?

In case of [in-browser compilation](http://riotjs.com/guide/compiler/#in-browser-compilation):
```html
<script src="path/to/modules/my-example/my-example.tag.html" type="riot/tag"></script>
```

In case of [pre-compilation](http://riotjs.com/guide/compiler/#pre-compilation), set the [custom extension](http://riotjs.com/guide/compiler/#custom-extension):
```bash
riot --ext tag.html modules/ dist/tags.js
```
